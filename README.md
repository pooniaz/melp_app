This project uses GRDB.swift for database.
https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/tree/master/Documentation/DemoApps/GRDBDemoiOS

it may contains few bugs.

Few points come to my mind after completing and analyzing:

1. TableViewController was choosen for handling potarait and landscape with ease without much complex structure. 
2. Detail for table view cell is currently, presented as modal that could be simple push on navigation controller.

Let me know, if you care looking for further refinement of solution.
